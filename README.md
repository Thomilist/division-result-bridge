# division-result-bridge

A tool for Danish orienteering event organisers hosting division matches, who are using [Divisionsmatchberegning](https://github.com/AndersKlinting/divisionsmatchberegning) to calculate division results, and who wish to publish these results live and online. It can post results to a [division-result-server](https://github.com/Thomilist/division-result-server/).

Looking to give it a try or just curious for more details? Have a look at [the project's website](https://thomilist.github.io/division-result-bridge/)! Every page is available in both Danish and English - including a full "getting started" guide.
