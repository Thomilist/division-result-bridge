For conventional events, where runners compete individually, live publication of results can easily be achieved with the online service <a href=\"{liveresults_link}\" target=\"_blank\">{liveresults_name}</a>.

Network conditions at orienteering events further complicate the matter, as connection to the wider internet is often established over mobile data. This typically implies the use of <a href=\"{cgnat_link}\" target=\"_blank\">{cgnat_name}</a>, rendering servers behind it invisible to the wider internet.",
