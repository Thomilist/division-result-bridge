Network conditions at orienteering events further complicate the matter, as connection to the wider internet is often established over mobile data. This typically implies the use of <a href=\"{cgnat_link}\" target=\"_blank\">{cgnat_name}</a>, rendering servers behind it invisible to the wider internet.",
